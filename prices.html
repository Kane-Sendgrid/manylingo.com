          <h3>AS LOW AS $0.10 A WORD</h3>
          <h4>ADD UP TO $0.12 PER WORD- AND GET IT WITHIN HOURS</h4>
          <p>NO TRICKS, NO HIDDEN FEES, THE PRICE IS FLAT</p>
          <p>Our cost only depends on the amount of words being translated. To get an idea of
          how much it will cost, you can easily perform word count with your MS Word
          counter (Tip: open your document in MS Word, select text you want to translate,
          go to Review Menu and click  on “Word Count”). Normally we charge just $0.10 per
          word, however if you need your text within 24 hours or sooner* the rate
          increases to  $0.12 per word (we also may charge $0.12 rate if the complexity of
          the work requires extra effort; additionally if your copy contains legal,
          medical or technical terms and you need an expedited translation the rate per
          word is $0.15). However if your text is less than 250 words we apply minimum
          fixed fee of $15 for regular and $25 for extra fast translation* (turnaround
          within hours depending on the volume). All other services like notarization,
          apostil, or hard copy delivery are add-ons to the translation price. For
          voice-over, transcreation, localization and proofreading services prices please
          contact us to learn the price.</p>
          <p>*Note: there are limitations  to 24 hours turnaround service, please contact us to verify if your document  qualifies.</p>
          <p>We offer you pricing, which is transparent and easy to understand. No
          need for time consuming price requests. All you need to know is: $0.10
          per word for regular translations and $0.12 per word for extra fast or
          complicated translations* . So, if your text is 1,000 words long, it
          will cost you just $70 or $100 for extra fast translation*. If you check
          the price range of our competitors, you may be astonished how much money
          you can save working with us! We offer you lowest prices in the
          industry, if you find a better deal we’ll beat it. What are you waiting
          for. Give us a call and find out for yourself!</p>
          
          <p>Important:</p>
          <p>Translation price is based on the source language (original text) word count.</p>
          <p>Charts, schemas, tables or pictures which cover less than half a page should be counted for 300 words, if it exceeds half a page size, but fits into a standard A4 sheet- it should be regarded as 600 words. Otherwise if it does not fit 1 page, every new page counts similarly.</p>
          <p>The average normal volume of translation between 1 language pair is 2500-5000 words daily.</p>
          <p>Depending on the workload it may take 5-10 days (often it may be much faster though)  to deliver the translation, however if you have large volume materials, terms should be negotiated separately before placing the order.</p>
          <p>If you need faster turnaround contact us beforehand so that we could work out a suitable solution.</p>
          <p>On national holidays or during weekends the translation price is 50% higher than regularly.</p>
