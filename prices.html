            <h5>ADD UP TO <strong>$0.12</strong> PER WORD - AND GET IT <strong>WITHIN HOURS</strong></h5>
            <p>NO TRICKS, NO HIDDEN FEES, THE PRICE IS FLAT</p>
          </div>
          <p>Our cost only depends on the amount of words being translated. To get an idea of how much it will cost, you can
            easily perform word count with your MS Word counter (Tip: open your document in MS Word, select text you want
            to translate, go to Review Menu and click on “Word Count”). Normally we charge just $0.10 per word, however if
            you need your text within 24 hours or sooner<strong style="vertical-align:top">*</strong> the rate increases
            to $0.12 per word (we also may charge $0.12 rate if the complexity of the work requires extra effort; additionally
            if your copy contains legal, medical or technical terms and you need an expedited translation the rate per word
            is $0.15). If your text is less than
            <u>500 words</u> we charge minimum fixed fee of <strong>$60</strong> for regular and <strong>$70</strong> for expedited
            translation. All other services are counted on top of the translation price. For voice-over, transcreation, localization,
            proofreading, visual editing and other services prices please contact us to learn the details.</p>
          <p class="small text-muted">*Note: there are limitations to 24 hours turnaround service, please contact us to verify if your document qualifies.</p>
          <p>We offer you pricing, which is transparent and easy to understand. No need for time consuming price requests.<br
            />
            <strong>All you need to know is: $0.10
          per word for regular translations and $0.12 per word for extra fast or
          complicated translations<b style="vertical-align:top">*</b></strong>.<br>
            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">
              <h4>SAMPLE:</h4>
              If your text is 1,000 words long, it will cost you just $100 or $120 for extra fast translation<strong style="vertical-align:top">*</strong>.

          <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
          <p>Translation price is based on the source language (original text) word count.</p>
          <p>Charts, schemas, tables or pictures which cover less than half a page should be counted for 300 words, if it exceeds
            half a page size, but fits into a standard A4 sheet - it should be regarded as 600 words. Otherwise if it does
            not fit 1 page, every new page counts similarly.</p>
          <p>The average normal volume of translation between 1 language pair is 2500-5000 words daily.</p>
          <p>Depending on the workload it may take 5-10 days (often it may be much faster though) to deliver the translation,
            however if you have large volume materials, terms should be negotiated separately before placing the order.</p>
          <p>If you need faster turnaround contact us beforehand so that we could work out a suitable solution.</p>
          <p>On national holidays or during weekends the translation price is 50% higher than regularly.</p>
