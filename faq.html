            <dt>What is a certified translation?</dt>
            <dd>Official documents may often require a certified stamp, that
            confirms the translation is accurate and original. Along with the
            translation at your request we provide a signed statement which
            certifies the accuracy and proficiency of translation (but not the
            validity of the original document).</dd>

            <dt>Do I need a certified translation?</dt>
            <dd>In general certified translation is needed in following cases: U.S. Immigration
department (USCIS), high school and university application or enrollment, legal,
state and Federal government official purpose.</dd>

            <dt>How does the translation process work?</dt>
            <dd>
                Make an order through our website.
                Our employees would pass it on to a proper translator.
                When accomplished the translation will be reviewed and grammar, formatting and spelling would be checked.
                Translation will be sent to you for approval. At this point you may request a free revision or approve the translation.
                Approved and finalized copy of the translation as well as the tracking number (if you order a hard copy) will be e-mailed to you.
            </dd>

            <dt>How do you keep my information secure?</dt>
            <dd>Your information is transferred through secure encryption line (256-bit SSL).
            Your personal or credit card details are never stored with us. All the operations are handled through our partner secure payment system.
            Your personal information or documentation is never shared with anyone outside. All your information is only visible to experts who have signed strict non-disclosure agreements, and once the job done and approved all the data is a subject to immediate termination on all sources of our media.</dd>

            <dt>What is your money back guarantee?</dt>
            <dd>We provide a 100% money back if for any objective reason the translation is not accepted by the USCIS or other official institution.</dd>

            <dt>Do you offer notarization?</dt>
            <dd>Our company does provide signed and stamped notarized documents. Notarization includes a wet ink signature from a representative of our company along with an ink stamp from the notary. In order to have our document notarized one of our team members should attend a notary office therefore we charge extra for this service.</dd>

            <dt>Can you send me a hard copy?</dt>
            <dd>As an option we offer a priority mail service with tracking. Within U.S. the delivery time is normally between 1-3 days, however it may drastically vary for international transitions. In case of extreme urgency we may do the overnight shipping. In order to learn more about this option please contact us.</dd>

            <dt>How much does it cost?</dt>
            <dd>Our cost depends only on the amount of words translated. You can easily check it with your MS Word (first select the text for translation, than go to Review and klick Word Count). Normally we charge just 0,07$ per word, however if you need expedited translation or the source copy is too complex the rate is 0,1$ per word (if both of the latter conditions we charge 0,12$ a word). If your text is less than 250 words, we charge minimum fixed fee of 15$ for regular and 25$ for extra fast translation. All other services like notarization, apostil, or hard copy shipment is counted on top of the translation price. Check our fees here.</dd>

            <dt>Can I get a quote?</dt>
            <dd>We offer you the most transparent and easy to check pricing. No need for time consuming price requests. The prices are stated at 0,07$ per word for regular translations and 0,1$ per word for extra fast translations (please check our pricing policy for more information) So, if your text is 1000 words long, it will cost you just 70$ or 100$ for extra fast translation. If you check the price range of our competitors, you may be astonished how much money you can save working with us! We offer you lowest prices in the industry, if you find a better deal we’ll beat it.</dd>

            <dt>Who will translate my documents?</dt>
            <dd>We only co-operate with linguists and expert translators who have been time-tested. The network of translators is spread around the world but we employ only highly professional ones who have several years of translation experience. Quite a few are certified translators and carry various accreditations, however there is no single harmonized certification, so this aspect varies per translator.</dd>

            <dt>How long does translation take?</dt>
            <dd>The time for translation depends on the word count, language pair and source document complexity. We shall try our best to deliver translation within estimated time frame or even exceed the average turnaround time estimated in the table below:</dd>

            <dt>How can I check status of my order?</dt>
            <dd>You can inquire the status of your order anytime by contacting you manager via our e-mail info@manylingo.com or through your account online (need to register).</dd>

            <dt>Can I modify or cancel my order?</dt>
            <dd>Everything possible would be done to enable modification of your order if needed, however such requests would be processed on case-by-case basis.
            Orders may only be cancelled within 1 hour after placement. Once the order is forwarded to a translator it can’t be cancelled any longer.
            We urge you to contact us immediately if modification or cancellation of your order is necessary.</dd>

            <dt>How do I request a revision on my translation?</dt>
            <dd>You can ask for a revision of your translation. If you need one, please contact your manager through e-mail: info@manylingo.com or through your account online (need to register).</dd>
