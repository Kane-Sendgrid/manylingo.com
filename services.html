<h3>WEBSITE TRANSLATION</h3>

<p>
    Explosive accessibility of Internet worldwide opens bigger opportunities for businesses. Currently the number of Internet users is reaching 3 billion!
</p>
<p>
    We have considerable experience in translating websites for a number of global companies and guarantee high quality of final product. Keeping in mind that website content may be very specific we pay extra attention to localization and transcreation especially when it comes to translation of the website into completely new language.  We understand that word to word translation alone may not work hence we pay attention to all elements of webpage, such as text, images and layout. We only work with the most talented and experienced translators who are native speakers and have experience in digital marketing, SEO and website development.
</p>
<p>
    We work with most digital data formats.
</p>

<a id="localization"></a>
<br><br><br>
<h3>LOCALIZATION</h3>
<p>
    This service guarantees that your message is perceived by the target group as intended, which may require more than just direct language-to-language translation. That is why our professionals ensure, that your message is understood by your target audience in the other country. If you choose our localization services, translation will sound entirely authentic.
</p>
<p>
    It means that once you decide to deliver your message to new countries and markets you got to be sure that your translation is truly native and all key elements like color, tone, numbers and images are at full compliance. No need to mention that all of the above may have a completely different connotation depending on language and cultural relevance. Therefore localization plays a vital role in translation demonstrating the power of understanding cultural perception.
</p>

<a id="transcreation"></a>
<br><br><br>
<h3>TRANSCREATION</h3>
<p>
    Transcreation is a special kind of translation services. In fact, it can be called “creative translation”, which adapts marketing and promotional materials to become entirely authentic to another country or culture.
</p>
<p>
    Transcreation is more than direct translation or even localization, because linguists have to pick up subtle messages and hidden meanings in the original document and transfer it over to another language. Such unobvious messages, when translated, need to stay true to the look and feel of the original copy. We always perform quick A/B split tests of our transcreated materials before sending them back to customer.
</p>
